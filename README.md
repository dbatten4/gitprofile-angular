GitHub profiles (AngularJS 1.3 Introduction)
==========================

## Objective
To get started using Angular, we are going to build a simple Github user search.  
To do this we're going to be using [Github's API](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#search-users).

Also in this walkthrough we're going to build a simple Angular application that demonstrates a few simple concepts:

* [Two-way data-binding](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/databinding)
* [Dependency injection](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/di)

In addition we're going to be introducing [bower](http://bower.io/), a package manager for the web.

## Getting started

`git clone https://github.com/dbatten4/gitprofile-angular.git` to clone the repository.
Run `bower install` to install the dependencies in the bower.json file and `npm install` to install the dependencies in the package.json file.

## Usage

This project currently does not have the capabilities to be hosted on a server. Run `open index.html` to interact with the UI.

## Running tests

run `karma start test/karma.conf.js` to run the tests
